# Music-Moderation-Discord-Bot
Designed, implemented, and utilized the Discord API to allow members to listen to music in voice chat and ban, unban, or kick those who are being disrespectful. Deployed onto a remote server using Heroku and Git, allowing the bot to be used and online constantly.  

Add it to you server using: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=802323007817121862&permissions=8&scope=bot

**Commands**

.kick (enter user name) = kicks user from discord server

.ban (enter user name) = bans user from discord server

.unban = unbans user from server

.join = allows bot to join a voice channel to play music

.play (enter youtube link) = plays the song in the voice channel so that everyone in the channel can hear it

.leave = disconnects bot from voice channel

.print (enter message) = sends a requested message in the discord chat 

.clear = makes clearing chats easier, clears all chat history (can be used for moderation)

.credits = gives credit to creator (me :) )

**I will be adding more features in the future, such as being able to pause the music while playing and adding a music playing queue**
